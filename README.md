Note:
Now if you are trying to test our app there is a little issue with yt-dlp on some devices. Our team is fixing this problem. 
If you need to immediately download YouTube video follow this steps:
1) Follow path: ./public/scripts/download.js.
2) In 45th line change this line: `const youtubedl = require('youtube-dl-exec')`.
3) Save all changes and run or build an app.
Sorry again for the inconvenience. (((

**Update: the bug was fixed.**
